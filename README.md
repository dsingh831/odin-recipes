This is a practice project for building a recipe website.

In this project, the goal would be to use everything I've learned about HTML so far. I believe 
i'll most likely have to show things like:

1) Setting up my boilerplate
2) Adding multiple pages beyond the index.html
3) Making ordered and unordered lists
4) Adding picutres
5) Adding headers, paragraphs, bold and italicized words
6) Of course, being able to make commits throughout with "active" phrasing, not past tense
